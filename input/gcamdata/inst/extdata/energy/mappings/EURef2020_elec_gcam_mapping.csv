# Title: EU Reference scenario to GCAM technology mapping
# Units: unitless scaling factor
# Source: NA
# Comments: Mapping between EU 2020 Reference scenario.  Conversion factor of 1 indicates at 1:1 mapping between Eu Ref & GCAM technologies.
# Storage costs all come from NREL ATB Battery storage costs
# Wind and PV with dedicated storage costs are assumed to equal costs of the underlying technologies plus four times the cost of ATB 2019's battery storage.
# This is because ATB reports costs for a 4-hour battery with 15-year lifetime. We assume an 8-hour battery with 30-year lifetime to be more consistent with storage requirements and technology lifetimes in GCAM.
# rooftop_pv costs represent a simple average of commerical and residential rooftop PV.
# inferred column indicates whether a technology cost is mapped directly from the ATB or is inferred via either (1) the shadow_tech cost ratio approach described above or (2) created from a composite of other technology costs (e.g. PV_storage costs are the sum of ATB PV costs and ATB Battery Storage costs).  This column is not used in the data processing.
